- theme & user style
  - attr/options = path or string
  - slot
- max should be ignored when count is defined (via attr or non-dynamic marks)
- non-dynamic themes
  - if there is a #mark group, skip marks setup and infer count
- issue for R&D star half fill, failed attempts:
  - two half elements leave floating gaps on scaling/animations
    - overlaping solve the gaps only with solid colors
  - gradients
    - can't use css grads on fill
    - svg gradients
      - needs duplication on each mark
      - needs duplication for each orientation (offset can't be set via css)
      - needs dynamic ids which can't be set via css (can't use vars on url())
    - fill with foreign object (css grad) hopefully isn't the only solution
